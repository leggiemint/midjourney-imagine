## V7 Photography Advantages

V7 significantly improves photorealistic generation:

- **Better skin textures** — Natural, detailed skin without uncanny valley
- **Improved eyes** — More realistic, properly lit eyes
- **Accurate anatomy** — Better hands, body proportions, poses
- **Lighting coherence** — More physically accurate light behavior
- **Film stock simulation** — More accurate emulation of film characteristics

**Tip**: Use `--draft` for quick iterations, then remove for final quality output.

## Common Photography Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Not specifying focal length | Add specific mm value for control |
| Forgetting lighting direction | Specify where light comes from |
| Over-complicating lighting setup | Start simple, add complexity |
| Ignoring --style raw | Essential for photorealism |
| Mixing film looks with digital | Choose one aesthetic |

---

## Notes

- Combine camera + lens + aperture + film stock for authentic photographic look
- `--style raw` is essential for photorealistic results
- Film stocks work best with appropriate lighting (e.g., Cinestill 800T with tungsten/neon)
- Experiment with combinations — not all terms work equally well together
